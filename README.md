## Introduction

**Laravel Pail** is a package that allows you to easily delve into your Laravel application's log files directly from the command line. Unlike other log tailing packages, **Pail** is designed to work with **any log driver**, including [Sentry](https://sentry.io) or [Flare](https://flareapp.io).

In addition, Pail focuses on the developer experience: it provides a sleek CLI interface, with a user-friendly design, and a set of useful filters to help you find what you're looking for.

## Installation

> **Requires [PHP 8.2+](https://php.net/releases/) with [PCNTL](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pcntl.php) extension.**

To get started, install Pail into your project using the Composer package manager:

> **Note:** Pail is currently in development and is not yet ready for production use.

```bash
composer require laravel/pail:1.x-dev
```

## Usage

To start tailing logs, run the `pail` command:

```bash
php artisan pail
```

To increase the verbosity of the output, avoiding truncation (â€¦), and displaying the entire log line including context and exception trace, use the `-v` option:

```bash
php artisan pail -v # -vvv for maximum verbosity that includes the entire exception trace
```

To stop tailing logs, press `Ctrl+C`.

### Filtering logs

#### `--filter`

Sometimes, you may want to filter logs by their entire content and for that, you can use the `--filter` option:

```bash
php artisan pail --filter="QueryException"
```

#### `--message`

You may also want to filter logs only by their message, using the `--message` option:

```bash
php artisan pail --message="User created"
```

#### `--level`

You may also want to filter logs by their level, using the `--level` option:

```bash
php artisan pail --level=error
```

#### `--user`

To filter logs by the authenticated user, the one that triggered the request, you can use the `--user` option:

```bash
php artisan pail --user=1
```
